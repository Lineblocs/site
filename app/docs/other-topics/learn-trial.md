# Trial Balance

all newly registered accounts on lineblocs are given a trial balance that they can use towards making / receiving calls and buying a number. we will discuss in this guide what trial balance you are given, what restrictions there are for trials and how to upgrade your account to a non trial account.

## Trial Balance

new accounts on lineblocs.com are given $5.00 they can use towards making/receiving calls and buying upto 1 number. Once you go below this credit you will be required to upgrade to a "Standard User".

## Restrictions

currently all trial accounts can register only 1 number and have restrictions for incoming/outbound call time as well as the amount of recording space they can use up. below is a list of restrictions on trial accounts:

1. 1 number local only
2. up to 3 minutes of outbound/inbound call time
3. upto 32MB recording space

to upgrade your account and remove the trial account restrictions you simply need to add a valid payment option and an amount of credit. for more info on payment options or adding credit please see [Payment Options](http:///lineblocs.com/resources/billing-and-pricing/payment-options)
