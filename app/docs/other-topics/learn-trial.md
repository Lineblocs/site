# Trial Balance

Lineblocs currently offers trial memberships to all new users. In this guide, we will go over trial account restrictions and how to upgrade from a trial account.

## Restrictions

At this time, we enforce restrictions on all Lineblocs trial accounts â€“ these restrictions apply to any account regardless of the Lineblocs membership.

Trial Account Restrictions:

1. 1 Local Number only
2. Max 3 minutes of outbound/inbound call time

## Upgrading

You can upgrade your account to a non-trial account. Please note that depending on the type of account you are registered under (Pay as you go or dedicated), the steps may vary.

#### Dedicated Membership

To upgrade your account to a dedicated membership, please add a valid billing method.

If you wish to use pay-as-you-go plan, you will need to add a valid billing method and an amount of credit.
