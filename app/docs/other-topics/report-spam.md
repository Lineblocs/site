# Reporting Call Spam

Lineblocs tries to prevent call spam internally, using an array of methods. However, call spam is still possible and a profound threat to any cloud-related calling service.

## Reporting Calls

To report spam-related calls, please reach out to us using our [Contact Us](https://lineblocs.com/contact) page.

Please be sure to provide us the following details:

1. The number that is spamming you
2. Your number
3. Your full name
4. The day and time you have received unwanted calls

### Report Review

Once you submit your request, our support team will reach out to you in 24-48 hours.

If we find out this is a case of call spam, we will take immediate action to penalize the user that has been responsible for the call spamming.
