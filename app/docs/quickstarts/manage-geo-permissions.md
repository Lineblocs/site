## Empower Your VoIP Communication with Custom Geo Routing Rules

In our continuous efforts to enhance your experience with our platform, we're thrilled to introduce a powerful new feature that puts you in control of your VoIP calls like never before. With our latest update, you can now explicitly define routing rules for your calls, allowing you to make and receive calls from specific countries of your choice. This level of customization empowers you to optimize your communication strategy, streamline costs, and ensure seamless connectivity. In this article, we'll walk you through the steps to get started with this exciting new capability.

## Introducing Custom Routing Rules

Our custom routing rules feature enables you to take charge of your VoIP calls by deciding which countries you want to connect with. Whether it's establishing stronger connections with clients in certain regions or managing costs by limiting calls to specific countries, this feature offers you unparalleled flexibility.

## How to Get Started

Follow these simple steps to start using the custom routing rules feature:

1. **Log In**: Login to the [Lineblocs User Portal](https://app.lineblocs.com/#/login) using your credentials. If you're new to our platform, sign up to create an account.

2. **Navigate to Geo Routing Rules**: In the left menu bar click the Settings option and open Geo permissions

3. **Define Country Preferences**: In this section, you'll find a list of countries along with their corresponding risk levels. You can enable or disable each country based on your preferences and risk assessment. Enabling a country will allow you to make and receive calls from that region, while disabling it will block calls to and from that area.

Note that we provide risk level information for each country to help you make informed decisions about your communication strategy. The risk level indicates the potential challenges or security concerns associated with making calls to or from that country. This allows you to prioritize your communication efforts while mitigating potential risks.


4. **Save Your Settings**: After you've selected your preferred countries, don't forget to save your settings. This step ensures that your custom routing rules are applied to your VoIP calls.

5. **Test and Fine-Tune**: Once your custom routing rules are in place, make a test call to ensure that your settings are working as expected. If you encounter any issues or wish to adjust your preferences, you can always return to the "Routing Rules" section to make changes.

## Benefits of Custom Routing Rules

- **Enhanced Control**: Tailor your communication strategy by deciding which countries you want to interact with, offering a more focused and efficient approach.

- **Cost Optimization**: By restricting calls to certain countries, you can manage expenses more effectively, especially when making international calls.
